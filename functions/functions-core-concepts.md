# 🐍 Chapter 04: Functions


## 📝 Core Concepts

### Function Definition
* In Python a function is some reusable code that takes arguments as input, does some computation, and then returns a result or results.
* We define a function using the def reserved word.
* We call/invoke the function by using the function name, parentheses, and arguments in an expression.

---

### Functions Types  in Python: 
* Built-in functions e.g. print(), input(), type(), float(), int().
* Functions that we define ourselves and then use.

---

### Type Conversions
* When you put an integre and floating point in an expression, the integer is impplicitly converted to a float.
* You can control this with the built-in functions int() and float().

---

### String Conversions
* You can also use int() and float() to convert between strings and integers.
* You will get an error if the string does not contain numeric characters.

---

### Building Own Funtions
* A new function is created by using the def keyword followed by optional parameters in parentheses.
* Indent the body ot the function.
* This defines the function but doesn't execute the body of the function.
