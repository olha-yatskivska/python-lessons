## Object Oriented

* A program is made up of many cooperating objects
* Instead of being the "whole program" - each object is a little "island" within the program and cooperatively working with other objects.
* A program is made up of one or more objects working together - objects make use of each other's capabilities.

## Object
* An Object is a bit of self-contained Code and Data
* A key aspect of the Object approach is to break the problem into smaller understandable parts (divide and conquer)
* Object have boundares that allow us to ignore un-needed detail
* We have been using objects all along: String Objects, Integer Objects, Dictionary Objects, List Objects
* Objects hide detail - they allow us to ignore the detail of the "rest of the program"

## Defintions 
* **Class** - a tenplate - Berry
* **Method or Message** - A defined capability of a class - check_ripeness(), get_sweetness
* **Field or attribute** - A bit of data in a class - weight=5g, color='red'
* **Object** or **Instance** - A particular instance of a class - Raspberry, Blueberry

## Terminology: Class
* Defines the abstract characteristics of a thing (object), including the thing's characteristics (its attributes, field or properties) and the thing's behaviours (the things it can do, or methods, operations or features)
* A pattern (exemplar) of a class.

## Terminology: Instance (Object)
* One can have an instance of a class or a particular object
* The instance iis the actual object created at runtime
* The set of attributes of a particular object is called iits state
* The object consists of state and the behavior that's defined in the object's class

## Terminology: Method (Message)
* An object's abilities.
* In language, methods are verbs
* Within the program, using a method usually affects only one particular object

## Object Lifecycle
* Object are created, used and discarded
* We have special blocks of code (methods) that get called
  * At the moment of creation (constuctor)
  * At the moment of destuctiion (destuctor)
* Constuctors are used a lot
* Destructors are seldom used

## Constuctor
* The primary purpose of the constuctor is to set up some instance variables to have the proper initial values when the object is created
* In OOP, a constructor in a class s a special block of statements called when an object is created

## Many instances 
* We create lots of objects - the class is the template for the object
* We can store each distint object in its own variable
* We call this having multiple instances of the same class
* Each instance has ts own copy of the instance variables

## Inheritance
* When we make a new class - we can reuse an existing class and inherit all the capablities of an existing class and then add our own little bit to make our new class and then add our own little bit make our new class 
* Another form of store and reuse 
* Write once - reuse many times
* The new class (child) has all the capabilities of the old class (parent) - and then some more
* "Subclasses" are more specialized versions of a class, which inherit attributes and behaviors from their parent classes, and can introduce their own 


## Definition
* **Class** - a template
* **Attribute** - a variable within a class
* **Method** - a function within a class
* **Object** - a particular instance of a class
* **Constructor** - code that runs when an object is created
* **Inhertance** - the ability to extend a class to make a new class
