# Exercise 2: Write a program that categorizes each mail message by which day of the week the commit was done. 
# To do this look for lines that start with “From”, then look for the third word and keep a running count of each of the days of the week. 
# At the end of the program print out the contents of your dictionary (order does not matter).
counts = dict()
name = input("Enter file:")
try:
  fhandle = open(name)
except:
  print("File cannot be opened:", name)
  quit()

for line in fhandle:
  line = line.rstrip()
  words = line.split()
  if len(words) < 3 or words[0] != 'From':
    continue
  
  day = words[2]   
  counts[day] = counts.get(day,0) + 1
