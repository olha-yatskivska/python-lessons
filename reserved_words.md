# 🗝️ Python Reserved Words (Keywords)

In Python, **Reserved Words** (or Keywords) have special fixed meanings. You cannot use them as identifiers (names for variables, functions, or classes).

## 📋 Complete List of Keywords

| Keyword | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `and`, `or`, `not` | Logical operators for boolean logic. |
| `if`, `elif`, `else` | Conditional branching. |
| `for`, `while` | Loops for iteration. |
| `break`, `continue` | Loop control: stop a loop or skip to the next iteration. |
| `def` | Used to define a function. |
| `return` | Exits a function and returns a value. |
| `class` | Used to define a new user-defined object class. |
| `import`, `from`, `as` | Used to include external modules/libraries. |
| `try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise` | Exception handling (error management). |
| `True`, `False`, `None` | Constant values (Boolean and Null). |
| `is`, `in` | Identity and membership operators. |
| `lambda` | Creates anonymous (short) functions. |
| `with` | Simplifies exception handling (e.g., when opening files). |
| `global`, `nonlocal` | Used to handle variable scope. |
| `pass` | A null statement (does nothing, used as a placeholder). |
| `del` | Deletes an object or variable. |
| `yield` | Used in generators (advanced functions). |
| `async`, `await` | Used for asynchronous programming. |



## 💡 Important Rules
1. **Case Sensitivity:** Most keywords are lowercase (like `if`, `for`), but three start with a capital letter: `True`, `False`, and `None`.
2. **Naming Conflict:** If you try to name a variable after a keyword, Python will raise a `SyntaxError`.
