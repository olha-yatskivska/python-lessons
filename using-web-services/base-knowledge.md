## XML - eXtensible Markup Language
* Primary purpose is to help information system share structured data
*  **Tags** indicate the beginning and ending of elements
*  **Attributes** - keyword/value pairs on the opening tag of XML
*  **Serialize/De-Serialize** - Convert data in on program into a common format that can be stored and/or transmitted between systems in a programming language-independent manner
*  White space is generally discarded on test elements/ We indent only to be readable
* There is a hierarchical stucture within an XML document: simple element (node), complex element (node) with child tags
* Within one simple node you can only have one text element.
