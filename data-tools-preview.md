# 📊 Data Tools Preview: Pandas

## 📝 Overview
**Pandas** is the most popular Python library for data analysis. If Python is the engine, Pandas is the high-tech dashboard and steering wheel that allows you to handle massive amounts of data with ease.

### Why for a Test Analyst?
* **Automated Data Validation**: Compare two large CSV files or database exports automatically.
* **Bug Discovery**: Find outliers (like a negative price or a 200-year-old user) in seconds.
* **Reporting**: Generate summary tables and statistics for your test results.
